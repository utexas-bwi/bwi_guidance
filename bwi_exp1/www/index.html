    <h2> Instructions </h2>
    Please read the instructions thoroughly before proceeding.
    <h4> Experiment Goal </h4>
    <ul> 
      <li>
      In these experiments, you'll be controlling a simulated person to find a 
      red ball located somewhere on the floor. The floor is approximately 50m by 50m in size. Images of the simulated person and the ball are below. <br />
      <img height="200" src="images/person.png" /> <img height="100" src="images/ball.png" />
      </li>
      <li>
      The ball you are trying to locate may be in an open area where it is
      easy to see, or it might be inside a room and not easily
      visible from the outside through the doorway. Once you find
      the ball, run into it to proceed to the next experiment.
      </li>
      <li>
      Your goal will be to find the ball as quickly as possible. At the end of 
      each experiment, you will receive a score based on how fast you were 
      able to locate the ball. Your score for that experiment will be added to
      your total.
      </li>
      <li>
      We'll begin with a couple of tutorials to get you started. After that
      there will be 6 experiments.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h4> Robots </h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
      There will be some robots in the environment that will try and help you
      reach the destination. These robots are pictured below: <br />
      <img height="150" src="images/robot.png" />
      </li>
      <li>
      The robots will always try and do their best to direct you along the 
      correct path to the goal. However, there might not be enough robots
      available in an experiment to make the path to the goal easy to follow.
      </li>
      <li>
      When you approach a robot, an arrow will pop up pointing you in the 
      right direction. If an arrow does not pop up, it means the robot is 
      there performing some other task, and you should ignore that robot.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h4> Using the mouse to look </h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
      You can use the mouse to look around if your browser supports it. Hit the 
      "Use Mouse!" button when you enter the experiment.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
    It will take you between 15-30 minutes to complete the entire set of
    experiments, so make sure you have enough time to proceed. <br/>
